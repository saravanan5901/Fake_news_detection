# Fake_news_detection
Fake news detection using supervised training models in python.

We have built a model that catches many intuitive indications of real and fake news. This project demonstrate the ability for machine learning to be useful in this task. We have used various models like Logistic Regression, Perceptron, Svm, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Naive bayes, KNN to train the data. We have also used Pca and K-means Clustering to group data into two principal components and visualise it and also compared the various models based on their accuracy scores.
